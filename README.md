# Erin's Image Directory
This is where I store my Notion Banners, iPhone/iPad/Mac Wallpapers, and avatars I use everywhere online. I wanted to share this as an easy place to stay updated so other people can update the images and add their own as well. I am always open to adding more. If you want to add some, you will want to make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and add your images.

This is also a good place to get wallpapers for your phone or banners: [https://github.com/SniperGER/iOS-Wallpapers](https://github.com/SniperGER/iOS-Wallpapers)

## Wallpapers
These are all of the wallpapers I switch between and have gathered for my phone. They may work as banners in Obsidian or Notion but are not guaranteed due to their aspect ratio. I organized these to show Desktop/iPad wallpapers as well as Phone wallpapers to make it easier for myself.

## Avatars
These are all of the avatars I use throughout the internet and switch between.

## Banners
These are banners I use on Notion or in my notes if I feel like having a banner.
