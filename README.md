# Erin's Image Directory
This is where I store my Obsidian/Notion Banners, iPhone/iPad/Mac Wallpapers, and avatars I use everywhere online. I wanted to share this as an easy place to stay updated so other people can update the images and add their own as well. I am always open to adding more. If you want to add some, you will want to make a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) and add your images.

## Wallpapers
These are all of the wallpapers I switch between and have gathered for my phone. They may work as banners in Obsidian or Notion but are not guaranteed due to their aspect ratio.

## Avatars
These are all of the avatars I use throughout the internet and switch between.

## Obsidian/Notion Banners
These are the settings I use and the banners I use for the [Obsidian Banners](https://github.com/noatpad/obsidian-banners) plugin. I do not take claim to ANY images here. I did not make any of them.

## Setup

To install the [Obsidian Banners](https://github.com/noatpad/obsidian-banners) plugin you will want to first install [Obsidian BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) as the version that works with desktop and mobile is not the one in the Obsidian Plugin store. It is version 2.0.5 beta.

Then inside of BRAT, you will paste the link for the Obsidian Banners plugin. That will install the latest beta version.

## Settings
These are all of my settings. It is easiest to upload pictures rather than explain them all. You will want to change the folder to your banners folder. The images I provide in my `banners` folder above, still keep my vault under 1GB. It is at 730MB and that may be because I also backup to GitHub and have the `.git` directory. Either way, you may want to trim down the number of images to your favorites.

## How to use my images
You will want to click on the code button above and download the `.zip` as shown in the image below.

Then you will need to unzip the folder and move the `banners` folder into your Obsidian Vault. Then make sure the banners plugin can find these images. Then you can see them all in the pop up.
